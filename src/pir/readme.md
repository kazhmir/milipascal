# PIR

This was a separate package, that need not to be.
So now it is all joined up, but in a separate folder.

The backends and algorithms are all here, bundled up together
with the data structures. Maybe it is better this way, i don't know,
seems sufficiently organized.

PIR stands for Padeir0's Intermediate Representation, in case
you're wondering.
